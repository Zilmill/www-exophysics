                The entire project, including code and website, is in the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a>
                to make it available to as many as possible.  All code can be
                found on <a href="https://github.com/exophysics">GitHub</a>.

                There's no paywall, advertisements, analytics, or anything that
                might distract from the project.  My motivation and my payment
                is to see what kind of beautiful creations you come up with.

                I'm an independent open source software programmer and digital
                artist, but also trapped in a human body. As such, I do require
                a minimal amount of human currency to sustain myself and keep
                my attention on creative endeavours.  Help me pay the bills so
                I can keep building more projects like these. :)  Any
                contributions are deeply appreciated.
