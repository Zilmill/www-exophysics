                The entire project, including code and website, is in the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a>
                to make it available to as many as possible.  All code can be
                found on <a href="https://github.com/exophysics">GitHub</a>.
                Feel free to contribute to the simulation code as well as to
                the website.

                There's no paywall, advertisements, analytics, or anything
                distracting.  My motivation and payment is to see what kind of
                beautiful creations you come up with.  If you build something
                nice, please send your HTML file to
                <u>curator&#3793;exophysics.net</u> :) </p>
            <p>
                If you do appreciate my work and would like to buy me the
                equivalent of a coffee, I invite you to check out my
                <a href="https://www.patreon.com/superhut">patreon page.</a>
                I'm not starving, but any contributions are appreciated and
                will allow me to focus on more projects like these.
