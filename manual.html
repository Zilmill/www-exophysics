            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Exophysics is a particle simulator in
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>
                + <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
                + <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">WebGL2</a>
                along with GLSL Shaders.  It is not physically correct, and
                that's not the intention.  On the contrary, exophysics invites
                you to explore the possibilities of universes that are not
                physically correct (according to your universe).
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that WebGL2 requires a modern browser and a modern
                graphics card to run.

                Safari tends to have problems, older phones seem to struggle,
                while older PCs &amp; laptops with a recent Firefox or Chromium
                seem fine.

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Let's dive into the
                <a href="https://github.com/exophysics/exophysics/blob/master/index.html">source code</a>.
                Technically, there is not "the one" source code of exophysics.
                Each universe is self-contained in its own HTML file, with no
                external dependencies.  This is necessary to ensure that it
                will still work when you get completely lost in the labyrinth
                of dimensions, outside of space and time, all alone in between
                the manifold realms of the multiverse, with no WIFI, no access
                to content delivery networks, and a completely dissolved
                software ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, the code of exophysics will naturally diverge.
                There is still a basic common structure though, as can be seen
                in this architecture diagram:

                </center>
            <p>
                The main 5 parts of the program are the following, which will
                be explained in more detail in the next chapters.

                <li>The "parameters" object, for tweaking basic settings</li>
                <li>The <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Shader">vertex shader</a> code that describes the laws of physics</li>

                <li>The JavaScript code that takes care of the uninteresting plumbing</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>
                HTML is a human-era "mark-up language" that describes websites
                through a sequence of magic words and symbols.  E.g. if you
                write "<code>&lt;title&gt;Exophysics&lt;/title&gt;</code>" in a
                certain section of the file, it will set the title of the page
                to "Exophysics".  The magic rune "<code>&lt;script&gt;</code>"
                allows you to embed fragments in other languages like
                JavaScript and GLSL within the file.
            </p>
            <p>
                The HTML scaffold can typically be ignored. It serves mainly as
                a container for the other components, some HTML meta
                information, as well as a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, into
                which WebGL will render the universe.
            </p>
            <h3>Parameters</h3>
            <p>
                "<code>parameters</code>" is a JavaScript variable that's
                defined in a separate block, right before the Vertex Shader,
                for your convenience.  It defines a few basic options of
                Exophysics like the Particle Limit.
            </p>
            <h3>Vertex Shader</h3>
            <p>
                The vertex shader is the core of exophysics which defines the
                laws of physics and determines the unfolding of the universe as
                time progresses.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-shaders-and-glsl.html#vertex-shader">Here is a good tutorial on the fundamentals of vertex shaders.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The vertex shader is written in the programming language GLSL
                ("OpenGL Shading Language"), a C-like language which is
                compiled to something that runs directly on the graphics card.
                It receives a set of data as the input, and computes the
                position of a vertex, e.g. a corner of a triangle, or the
                coordinates of a point.  The strength of vertex shaders is that
                they run in parallel.  If you want to compute the positions of
                2000 points, it's run on 2000 (if available) processing units
                of your graphics card at the same time, making it fast enough
                for 3D games or a simulation like exophysics.
            </p>
            <p>
                For each particle in the exophysics universe, one vertex shader
                is run on one processing unit of your GPU with an individual
                set of input data.  The vertex shader then calculates the next
                position (and any other state information) of the particle and
                then makes it available to the JavaScript part through a
                mechanism called "transform feedback".  The javascript code
                then feeds back the output as input to the vertex shader when
                the next frame is drawn, creating an infinite loop in which the
                universe unfolds.
            </p>
            <p>
                The vertex shader varies strongly between individual universes.
                It is therefore recommended to comment it extensively.  There
                are stories aplenty of adventurers entering a universe, getting
                entirely lost in a labyrinth of code, and never finding a way
                back home.
            </p>
            <h4>Changing physical constants</h4>
            <p>
                One interesting part of the vertex shader is the definitions of
                the physical constants.  This might look like:
            </p>
            <pre><code>const float floorGravity = 0.0;
const float particleGravity = 0.0;
const float flavorAttraction = -0.05;
const float numFlavors = 3.0;
const float bounceDampeningFactor = 0.99;
const float maxV = 0.01;
const float maxAccel = 0.01;
...</code></pre>
            <h4>Changing physical laws</h4>
            <p>
                The vertex shader also defines the laws of physics, for
                example, the gravitational attraction between particles:
            </p>
            <pre><code>// Attraction of particles towards each other
if (particleGravity != 0.0) {
    vec4 particle_pos;
    vec4 center_of_mass;
    center_of_mass = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; particleLimit; i++) {
        particle_pos = allStates[i];
        center_of_mass += particle_pos;
    }
    center_of_mass /= float(particleLimit);
    vec2 dist = center_of_mass.xy - state.xy;
    dist = (attractionRotationMatrix * dist);
    vec2 accel = dist * particleGravity / weight;
    if (length(accel) &gt; maxAccel) {
        accel *= vec2(maxAccel / length(accel));
    }
    newV.xy += accel;
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                You can start by tweaking the physical constants first and see
                what happens, but don't be afraid to alter the laws of physics
                as well.  Be creative, think outside the box, tinker, and don't
                be afraid to break things.  Law #1 of exophysics ensures that
                no sentient being is harmed in the process.  In this
                expedition, there is no right and wrong, and only if you're
                brave enough, you can get a glimpse of the unexplored,
                inifinite possibilities of exophysics.
            </p>
            <h3>Fragment Shader</h3>
            <p>
                The fragment shader is, like the vertex shader, written in
                GLSL.  Fragment shaders are used to specify the color of a
                pixel.  If you draw a triangle, for example, the vertex shader
                would be run 3 times (once per corner of the triangle), and the
                fragment shader would be run once for every pixel that the
                triangle occupies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the case of vanilla exophysics, the only thing that's drawn
                is points.  For each point, the vertex shader is run once, and
                then the fragment shader is run once.  So instead of passing a
                lot of data between individual shaders, the author decided to
                simply compute the color in the vertex shader and pass it
                directly to the fragment shader.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fragment shader is therefore a stub, which only outputs
                what is passed as the input from the vertex shader.
            </p>
            <p>
                See more info on fragment shaders in the <a href="https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-shaders-and-glsl.html#fragment-shader">WebGL2 Fundamentals Tutorial Page</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>
                The JavaScript code contains functions for:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>initializing the WebGL2 state</li>
                <li>managing user interaction by registering event handlers for e.g. mouse clicks</li>
                <li>compiling and linking the vertex &amp; fragment shader</li>
                <li>managing the buffers for sending and receiving variables from/to the vertex shader</li>
                <li>triggering the drawing of the WebGL image into the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code></li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Unless you want to change any of the above (for example, pass
                extra information to the vertex shader), it will not be
                necessary to touch any JavaScript code.
            </p>
            <h4>Adding variables</h4>
            <p>
                These would be the steps to pass an extra variable from the
                JavaScript code to the vertex shader, if you ever need to:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Add an "<code>in</code>" variable to the vertex shader, like "<code>in float coolNumber;</code>"</li>
                <li>Add the variable to "<code>shaderInfo.attribs</code>" in "<code>initShaders</code>"</li>
                <li>Add a buffer in the "<code>initBuffers</code>" function</li>
                <ol>
                    <li><code>gl.bindBuffer(...);</code></li>
                    <li><code>gl.bufferData(...);</code></li>
                    <li><code>gl.vertexAttribPointer(...);</code></li>
                    <li><code>gl.enableVertexAttribArray(...);</code></li>
                    <li>Don't forget to add it to the returned object</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Set the data that the variable should receive in the "<code>drawScene</code>" function</li>
                <ol>
                    <li><code>gl.bindBuffer(...);</code></li>
                    <li><code>gl.bufferData(...);</code></li>
                </ol>
                <li>Now you just need to use the variable in the vertex shader.  Error messages may appear if the variable is unused, due to aggressive optimization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Adding uniforms</h4>
            <p>
                My advice is: <b>DO NOT ADD UNIFORMS</b>, since there's a
                uniform limit, and exophysics needs as many uniforms as
                possible for passing information about all particles to the
                shader through the "<code>allStates</code>" uniform.  See also
                the section "Particle Limit".
            </p>
            <h2>Particle Limit</h2>
            <p>
                The particle limit is defined in the "<code>parameters</code>"
                object, as well as in the "<code>particleLimit</code>" constant
                of the vertex shader.  As described in code comments, the
                number needs to be identical in both places, otherwise the
                universe will malfunction. The author did not find a way to
                have a single place for this parameter due to technical
                limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order for a particle to interact with all other particles,
                the state of each particle is passed to the vertex shader
                through a
                <a href="https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-shaders-and-glsl.html#uniforms">"uniform"</a>
                variable, typically called "<code>allStates</code>".
                Unfortunately, the size of uniform variables is restricted (see
                <code>MAX_VERTEX_UNIFORM_VECTORS</code>).  The limit depends on
                the device, with a minimum of 256 uniforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, there will be some devices which have a maximum
                number of particles of 256, and others with 2048 or higher.
                Exophysics will automatically reduce the number of particles to
                match the device specifications. But since the universe works a
                little differently depending on the number of particles, it's
                generally a good idea to set a hard particle limit of 256, so
                the universe's properties will unfold identically on each
                device.  Of course, if you want more, go for it.
